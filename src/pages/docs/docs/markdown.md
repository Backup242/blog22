## Why markdown?

Markdown is a universal doc format that is easy to write and easy to add to a version control system.

- **Open** - Anyone can submit content, fix typos & update anything via pull requests
- **Version control** - Roll back & see the history of any given post
- **No CMS lock in** - We can easily port to any static site generator
- **It's just simple** - No user accounts to manage, no CMS software to upgrade, no plugins to install.

---

## Markdown basics

The basics of markdown can be found [here](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) & [here](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/). Super easy!

## Advanced Formatting tips

### `left` alignment

<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="">

This is the code you need to align images to the left:

```
<img align="left" width="100" height="100" src="">
```

---

### `right` alignment

<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="">

This is the code you need to align images to the right:

```
<img align="right" width="100" height="100" src="">
```

---

### `center` alignment example

<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" src="http://www.fillmurray.com/460/300">
</p>

```
<p align="center">
  <img width="460" height="300" src="http://www.fillmurray.com/460/300">
</p>
```

---

### `collapse` Sections

Collapsing large blocks of text can make your markdown much easier to digest

<details>
<summary>"Click to expand"</summary>
this is hidden block
</details>

```
<details>
<summary>"Click to expand"</summary>
this is hidden
</details>
```

Collapsing large blocks of Markdown text

<details>
<summary>To make sure markdown is rendered correctly in the collapsed section...</summary>

1.  Put an **empty line** after the `<summary>` block.
2.  _Insert your markdown syntax_
3.  Put an **empty line** before the `</details>` tag

</details>

```
<details>
<summary>To make sure markdown is rendered correctly in the collapsed section...</summary>

 2. *Insert your markdown syntax*
 3. Put an **empty line** before the `</details>` tag

### Badges

I hate them so. Don't use badges.

---

### Nice looking file tree

For whatever [reason](https://twitter.com/alexdotjs/status/1421015442286596100) the `graphql` syntax will nicely highlight file trees like below:

```graphql
# Code & components for pages
./src/*
  ├─ src/assets - # Minified images, fonts, icon files
  ├─ src/components - # Individual smaller components
  ├─ src/fragments - # Larger chunks of a page composed of multiple components
  ├─ src/layouts - # Page layouts used for different types of pages composed of components and fragments
  ├─ src/page - # Custom pages or pages composed of layouts with hardcoded data components, fragments, & layouts
  ├─ src/pages/* - # Next.js file based routing
  │  ├─ _app.js - # next.js app entry point
  │  ├─ _document.js - # next.js document wrapper
  │  ├─ global.css - #  Global CSS styles
  │  └─ Everything else... - # File based routing
  └─ src/utils - # Utility functions used in various places
```

## Useful packages

## How Serverless uses markdown

Serverless.com is comprised of 3 separate repositories

- https://github.com/serverless/blog
- https://github.com/serverless/serverless | Shoutout to [Phenomic.io](https://phenomic.io/)
- https://github.com/serverless/site

**Why multiple repos?**

1. We wanted documentation about the framework to live in the serverless github repo for easy access
2. We wanted our blog content to be easily portable to any static site generator separate from the implementation (site)
3. `prebuild` npm script pulls the content together & processes them for site build

A single repo is easier to manage but harder for people to find/edit/PR content.

### DEMO

- Site structure
- Serverless build process
- [Validation](https://github.com/serverless/blog/blob/master/.travis.yml#L10)
- [Editing Flow](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/cli-reference/deploy/)
- Github optimizations
    - [Link from top of each doc to live link on site](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blob/master/docs/providers/aws/events/schedule.md)
    - use markdown magic =) to [auto generate tables](https://github.com/serverless/examples) etc
    - [Hide yaml frontmatter from github folks](https://github.com/serverless/serverless/blame/master/docs/providers/aws/events/schedule.md#L1-L7)
    - consider linking everything to site
